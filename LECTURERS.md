#### **Set Up GitHub Classroom**

1. **Create a GitHub Classroom**:

   - Go to [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and sign in with your GitHub account.
   - If you haven't created a classroom yet, click **"New classroom"** and follow the prompts to set up your classroom.

2. **Create an Assignment**:

   - In your classroom, click on **"New assignment"**.
   - Choose **"Individual assignment"** if students will work individually, or **"Group assignment"** if they will work in teams.

3. **Configure the Assignment**:

   - **Assignment Title**: Provide a name for the assignment (e.g., "Tic Tac Toe Game").
   - **Repository Settings**:
     - **Template Repository**: Select the template repository you created earlier (`tic-tac-toe-starter`).
     - **Public/Private**: Choose whether student repositories should be public or private.
   - **Deadline** (optional): Set a deadline for the assignment submission.

4. **Set Up Teams (for Group Assignments)**:

   - If you selected **Group assignment**, click **"Set up teams"**.
   - Choose whether to let students create their own teams or require them to join pre-defined teams:
     - **Students create their own teams**: Students can create their own teams when accepting the assignment invitation.
     - **Pre-defined teams**: You set up the teams in advance and students join them.

5. **Invite Students**:
   - GitHub Classroom will generate a unique URL for the assignment. Share this link with your students.
   - Students use the link to accept the assignment and will either clone the template repository (if it’s an individual assignment) or join a team and clone the repository (if it’s a group assignment).
