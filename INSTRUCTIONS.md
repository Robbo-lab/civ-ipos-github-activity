### Instructions

1. **Fork the Repository**:

   - Each group member should fork the repository to their own GitHub account.

2. **Add Collaborators**:

   - Add the other group members as collaborators with reviewer permissions.

3. **Choose a Task**:

   - Each student should choose either a bug fix or a new feature to implement using python. Possible new features could include:
     - Adding a score counter that persists between games.
     - Implementing an AI opponent.
     - Allowing players to choose their symbol (X or O) at the start of the game.
     - Adding sound effects or animations for moves.

4. **Create a Branch**:

   - Create a new branch for the feature or bug fix, following good branching practices (e.g., `feature/score-counter` or `bugfix/fix-reset-logic`).

5. **Develop and Test**:

   - Make the necessary changes, and thoroughly test the new functionality or bug fix.

6. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:

   - Once the work is complete, create a PR and request reviews from the other group members.

7. **Review and Merge**:
   - Review each other's code, provide feedback, and approve the PR once all issues are resolved. After approval, merge the PR into the `main` branch.
